# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

**Note**: feel free to use the package manager of your choice.

## Local Development

```bash
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Deployment is automatic: pushing to `main` with changes under `website/` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`, which builds this site and publishes it to the `gh-pages` branch. There is no manual `npm run deploy` step for this project.
